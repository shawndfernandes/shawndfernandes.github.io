            Hi All,<br />
            <br />
            As part of my work experience as a  Quality Assurance Consultant, I have written and authored selenium automation scripts for the UI.<br /><br />
            In the summer of 2017, I had performed my summer internship at Deloitte, working as a Software Quality Assurance Intern.<br /><br />
        </p><hr /><hr />
        <p>
            As part of my Graduate Masters Curriculum, our assignments consisted of projects with Python, MATLAB and C Programming Languages. <br /><br />
            I have done assignments with MATLAB for different machine learning algorithms, Embedded C for real-time low latency embedded systems and C++ programming with openCV libraries for Computer Vision. <br />
            <br />
        </p><hr /><p>
            My projects have included
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>C++ Embedded client-router-server with openSSL support <br /> </li>
            <li>Arrythmia diagnosis from ECG waveform with Latent Semantic Analysis<br /> </li>
            <li> Side profile face detection using Cascade classifier with HOG features detector <br /> </li>
            <li> Supervised and deep learning techniques for multivariate classification of product sales based on recommendations and LSTM-RNN  <br /> </li>
        </ol><hr />
        <p>
            As part of my summer 2016 internship, I was working in the Eldercare Lab, part of the University of Missouri Engineering Division.<br />
            Alongside the team of other researchers, I have been involved in coding Unix bash scripts and working on C++ programming with Open CV and mysql libraries for the kinect v1 and LEPTON PureThermal USB camera.<br />
            I  had successfully cross compiled Windows code to Unix for the fall detection of kinect using Visual Studio IDE. I had also been involved with modifying PHP- webpages  with the Visual Studio IDE to reflect real time NAGIOS sever status via the mySQL DB.
            I had also created Java scripts to test the remote DB connection.<br /><br />
        </p><hr /><p>
            As part of handling the above coding tasks, I have made few contributions and helped resolve few issues, which I have mentioned below: <br /><br />
            <em>MATLAB:</em> <br />As part of compiling VLFeat source code on latest MS Visual Studio-2015, have resolved the Mex compilation issue.<br />

        <p><em>C++:</em><br /> As part of coding the combined C++ program for the kinect depth camera and USB thermal camera on openCV, I have made below changes to the openCV code to support rawstream from the thermal camera via UVC libraries, and helped resolve few compilation issues.<br /></p>

            My current research project involves working with a team involved with respiration detection using the Kinect Depth camera, and implementation of Murata embedded bed sensors for data collection<br />
