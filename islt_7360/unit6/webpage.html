        <p>
            I 'd just like to say there's a lot to like about your website. I like the background color and the white text. It's a very soothing scheme.<br />
            Your information is organized well and all the links seem to function as they should.
            <br />The one thing I noticed is your external links don't open new pages. It's easy to just click the back arrow and go back to the original site, but it may be more user friendly to have new windows open in case someone was interested in seeing info in both pages.
            <br /> It's nothing major and may be more trouble than it's worth to change it. Great job!


            <br />

        <h3>Peer2</h3>
        <p>
            <br />In general, I like the colors you chose for your website. At first, it seems pretty easy on the eyes, but after I was looking at it for a while, it became a little more stressful.<br />

            I LOVE how your navbar slowly fades to green when you mouse over it. What a cool feature!<br />

            Looking over your html, I would suggest that instead of having some of your heading and body styling in the html, you can put it in your css. <br />That would make the html "cleaner" and you wouldn't have to have it repeated on each page. For css, it would be something like

            h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {

            text-align: center;

            }

            body {

            background-color: #0077b6;

            color: #ffffff;

            }
            <br />
            I will echo Peer1 in that it would be nice if some of your links, like the one to your github, opened in a new window.

            Overall, great job!

            <br /> <br />
