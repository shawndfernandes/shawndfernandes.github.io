<!--Heading 1-->
<h1 align="center">Shawn Fernandes's Basic Webpage</h1>

<!--Paragraph tag-->
<p>This is the first webpage that I have ever created. I feel so excited! As I think about the topic of my final website, here are some possibilities:</p>

<!--Heading 3 and the first Logical Style (Emphasized text) -->
<h3><em>Topic1</em></h3>

<!-- Physical Style of bold and underlined text -->
<p><b><u>An online version of my Resume</u></b> </p>
<p>My first idea would be to post my current resume via a webpage</p>

<!--Blockquote and The second Logical Style (citation/reference) -->
<blockquote><cite>Beijing Opera is the only art form that can truly represent China because it keeps together the diverse elements in Chinese culture: history, mythology, literature and poetry, singing, dancing, acting, face painting, stage fighting and acrobatics </cite></blockquote> 

<p>The purpose of my final project would be to build a webpage that serves as an online Curriculum Vitae. <br/>It would highlight my projects, internships and work experience in detail. <br/>It would have URL's to various other social media webpages with my profile such as Github, LinkedIn, Facebook.
    <br/><br/>
    Based on github compatibility and If time permits, I might add the enhancement of editing the content / webpage with password authentication. <br/>I also plan to integrate scrolling info tabs to highlight few keywords from my Curriculum Vitae. <br/>I might extend the functionality for any person to create their own webpages in the similar manner, after they are authenticated with their valid email ID’s.
    <br/><br/>
    The website would accomplish the task of collating all of my social media presence in one place, making it easier to view my profile.<br/> I plan to integrate all of the other URL's into this webpage. It would be like a customized interactive Curriculum Vitae.<br/> It would also feature options for reviews and viewers to post their comments and replies, which support emoji’s, which can be deleted by me. 
    <br/><br/>
    The source of the main content of my wesbite would be my Curriculum Vitae. <br/>I also plan to integrate animation and graphics that enhance the overall look of the webpage, keeping in mind github compatibility.
    <br/><br/>
    Other websites which I am aware of that serve similar functionality would be linkedin. <br/>However, my webpage has an advantage of being customized and interactive. <br/>I believe that this would be a new approach to make your Curriculum Vitae stand out.</p>

<!--Heading 3 and Logical Style of Emphasized text-->
<h3><em>Topic2</em></h3>

<!--Physical Style of bold and underlined text -->
<p><b><u>Online Travel Collage</u></b></p>

<p> Another idea is to make a website that has photo albums from all the cities that I have toured in the US.<br/>It would list out my collections of photographs from the below cities </p>
<!--list items-->
<ol>
<li>Columbia<li/>
<li>St.Louis </li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Bismarck</li>
<li>New York</li>
<li>Las Vegas</li>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
<li>Carmel</li>
<li>San Francisco</li>
</ol>
<p>I plan to incorporate thumbnails in order to optimize the webpage.<br/> I also plan to include the functionlaity of a slideshow for the images, along with options to download HD versions of the pictures and options for guest comments.</p>
