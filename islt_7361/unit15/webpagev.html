        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to create a video file that consists of a blend of atleast two videos with a background music track. The transition between the videos should be with an effect.<br />

            I chose to make a video about the seven natural wonders of the world, as mentioned by the below websites.<br /><br />

            <a href="http://sevennaturalwonders.org/">Seven Natural Wonders</a> <br />

            <a href="http://sevennaturalwonders.org/index_/about-2/">Seven Natural Wonders - Index</a><br /><br />

            I then downloaded different videos from youtube for the seven different natural wonders. I also downloaded a sound track for the video from youtube.<br />

            Using SPG-Video Splitter, I extracted only a 5-10 second portion of the video of the several different natural wonders.<br />

            I then imported the different videos into windows movie maker, and then added background audio with effects.<br />

            I then exported the video with 800x600 resolution, and ensured correct encoder rate to ensure file size just below 10MB with optimal quality.<br />

        <h3>Peer Evaluation Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Peer1:</b> Wow! I loved the creativity of your project and that you weren't afraid to use video that wasn't your own. Great job citing your sources at the end, as required.<br /> I believe you met all of the requirements of the project like the dimensions/size of the video, the cross dissolves fading, still image, and music requirement, but I did notice that you did not include a cut transition between clips 1 and 2 as the requirements specified.<br /> I interpreted that requirement as there being no dissolve or other transition between clips-- just a raw jump from one clip to the next. Other than that small detail, you did a great job and I enjoyed watching your video!<br /><br />

            <b>Peer2:</b> Your video was really awesome.  I loved it.  It's hard to find anything to critique.  Your transitions were great and I thought the audio choice was perfect.  The only suggestion I can think of is to get the credits page to scroll slower. <br /> I'm trying to figure that out myself.  Or, if that can't be done, maybe put some spaces between the lines so that we have time to read each line?  I might do that myself.
            Loved your video.  You have a knack for this stuff.  Great job:)<br /><br />
            <b>Peer3:</b> I really love your music choice. I think it goes really well with the natural phenomena that you're showing. It makes it all seem very dramatic and cinematic, which I like.I also like that you caption your video because otherwise it would be difficult to tell what we're supposed to be looking at and where it is. <br />The only thing I can think of that could improve your video would maybe to use a different transition, like a cross fade or dissolve. THe pixelated one is nice but a little distracting. Other than that, I really like your video.<br /><br />

            <b>Peer4:</b> I thought your video was great.  I liked your theme and thought your transitions looked good.  The wording on a few of them were a little hard to read because of the white and the background but that is just looking for something to critique.  I agree with some of the others that the credits went to fast.  Other then that great job.
