        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to create an audio file that consists of a blend of two tracks. The first track contains vocal information that is superimposed over a background music track. I have made use of two effects, fading and voice enhancement.<br /><br />
            I chose the speech given by Steve Jobs to the graduates of Stanford as my vocal track. I then selected a piano instrumental track as background music.<br /><br />

        <p>The steps taken to create the final audio file</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Import the audio track into Audacity, by clicking on File->open and selecting the audio file.</li>
            <li>Click on the zoom in / zoom out feature to time scale the track, for more accurate start and end timestamp selection on the file.</li>
            <li>Delete the required selections of the audio tracks, by clicking on Edit -> Delete on the file menu.</li>
            <li>You can time shift the tracks by selecting the track in audacity, and clicking on the time shift tool.</li>
            <li>To add effects, select a portion of the audio track, and navigate to effects menu</li>
            <li>I initially amplified the beginning of the audio track, by using Effect->Amplify</li>
            <li>For the fade in effect, I used Effect->Fade In. I applied fade in effect before and after the vocal track on the background music track</li>
            <li>I then created two copies of the vocal track by selecting Edit->Duplicate. </li>
            <li>I made one copy of the vocal track to play on the left channel only, the other vocal track copy to play on the right channel only</li>
            <li>I slightly time-shifted the two vocal copies of the audio track, one slightly before the original vocal track, one slightly after the vocal track.</li>
            <li>I then selected all the audi tracks, and exported the audio file to MP3 format by navigating to File->Export Audio.  </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Peer Review Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            I really love your file! At first I was taken aback by the "echo" effect, but overall I think it really works! Almost haunting! My only suggestion might be to fade out the background just a hair more, so it's really clear that it fades out!<br /><br />
            Other than that, great job!
        </p>

        <h3>Peer Review Discussion</h3>
        <!--Heading 3 and Logical Style of Emphasized text-->
        <p>I referred a Youtube video for methods to enhance the vocals. I found one method, whose technique involved time shifting the vocal track.<br /> To further elaborate, I had to make two copies of the vocal track. I select one of the copy of the vocal track to play on the left channel only, and the other copy to play on the right channel only.<br /> I then had to slightly time-shift the two copies of the vocals with respect to the original vocal track, one towards the left and the other towards the right. Initially, this shift was not very subtle, and the vocal track had an overbearing echo effect. After the review, I zoomed into the track further and then made a subtle time shift, which has reduced the echo effect but emphasized the vocal track.</p>
