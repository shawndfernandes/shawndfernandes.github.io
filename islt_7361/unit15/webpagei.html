        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is for creating a banner under the topic of parenting. The final image consists of one background image, two foreground images, and text.
            <br />

        <h3>Banner 1</h3>
        <p>
            The steps taken to create the Final image.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new photo shop document. This can be done by navigating to the File->New option.</li>

            <li>Import the background image as a layer. This can be done by navigating to the File-> Place Embedded option, and selecting the background image.</li>

            <li>	The background image needs to be scaled to the desired size. For this, click on the background image, then navigate to Edit-> Transform -> Scale. </li>

            <li>	Create a new photoshop document, to open one of the foreground images.</li>

            <li>	Import the foreground into the new document by navigating to the File-> Place Embedded option, and selecting the foreground image.</li>

            <li>	In order to Crop the foreground image, the image must be rasterized. After importing the image and clicking on it, photoshop would pop a dialog for converting the smart object into a rasterized image. Select yes.</li>

            <li>	Once the smart object has been rasterized, select the eraser tool from the left hand side menu.</li>

            <li>	You may now erase portions of the image, in order to crop out and keep only the required regions of the image. In order to zoom into the image, you can make use of the zoom function beside the toolbar. You may also change the size of the eraser tool by clicking on [ or ] to vary the size. The top of the toolbar below the file menu also gives us the type and shape of eraser tool that can be selected.</li>

            <li>	One the foreground has been cropped, then drag the foreground to the title of the background image, then a new layer of the foreground image gets created in the background image.</li>

            <li>	Scale the layer of the foreground image to the required size by navigating to Edit-> Transform -> Scale.</li>

            <li>	Repeat the same process for the second foreground image, ensuring it gets imported as a new layer over the background image.</li>

            <li>	We can vary various properties of the layers, such as opacity / transparency, with the tools present in the layer command.</li>

            <li>	In order to add various style effects to the layer, we can right click the desired layer in the layer toolbox, and then select Blending options. We can then apply various blending options such as Bevel and Emboss, Contour, Texture, Stroke, Inner Shadow, Inner Glow, Satin, Color Overlay, Gradient Overlay, Pattern Overlay, Outer glow and Drop shadow.</li>

            <li>	The various blending options have numerous settings associated with them, for example, the Gradient Overlay has various options and parameters that can be configured, such as gradient styles and directions of the gradient. I have applied the rainbow gradient overlay to one of my foreground images.</li>

            <li>	Finally, we need to add text. Click on the text option on the left hand side, and add the required text. If the text is small, then it can be scaled using the Edit-> Transform -> Scale option.</li>

            <li>	Various text warp options can be applied using the Text Warp button on the top of the page. Different letters can be assigned various sizes and colors, depending on the background, for optimal contrast effect.</li>

            <li>	We finally export the finished image as a JPG format.</li>

        </ol>
        <hr />
        <h3>Icon</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>	In order to create the icon, we extract the image from either the cropped foreground or the completed image.</li>
            <li>	We then place that image in a new photoshop document.</li>
            <li>	We scale the image to 100 x 100 size, which is ideal for an icon.</li>
            <li> 	To select three colors, we navigate to Image->Mode->Indexed Color.</li>
            <li>	We then finally export the icon as a JPG image.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Peer evaluation feedback</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Peer1:</b> The images look good. The two foreground images are supposed to overlap in some way. The text is a little hard to read. Maybe enlarge a little. Maybe change the black text to something lighter or make it bolder. I can't tell if you used the gradient tool. Make sure you add that in. I forgot to do that on mine. Good job!<br /><br />

            <b>Peer2:</b> I love how you utilized the background and used the the foreground picture to make it look as if the family is walking up on top of the hill. However, one pointer I would suggest is to move them (if possible) so that both photos overlap each other. As Kimberly pointed out, the text at the top is very hard to read, so I would suggest using a different color to make it more appealing and easier to read. But very nice job with the masking tool!

        <h3>Peer review discussion</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Peer 1:</b> In my initial image, I had used maximum font size, but as per peer comments, it was still small. I then found out that the fonts could be scaled as required, and then scaled the fonts. My initial peer also commented on changing the color of the font in order to contrast with the background.
            I then found out that colors of the individual letters of the text can be varied. My peer also told me that the two foreground images need to overlap, and apply a more visible gradient overlay. I then applied the transformations based on the feedback provided.<br /><br />

            <b>Peer 2:</b> Peer two also suggested on overlapping the two foreground images, and changing the color and size of the text for more optimal contrast.
